    <h3> Numetal</h3>
    <p>Nu metal (sometimes stylized as nü-metal, with a metal umlaut) is a subgenre of alternative metal that combines elements of heavy metal music with elements of other music genres such as hip hop, funk, industrial, and grunge. Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of musical technique, and emphasizes rhythm with instrumentation that is heavily syncopated. Nu metal guitarists typically use seven-string guitars that are down-tuned to produce a heavier sound. Vocal styles are often rhythmic and influenced by hip hop, and include singing, rapping, screaming and sometimes growling. DJs are occasionally featured to provide instrumentation such as sampling, turntable scratching and electronic background music. Nu metal is one of the key genres of the new wave of American heavy metal.</p>

    <p> In the late 1980s and early 1990s, bands like Pantera, Helmet, and Faith No More were influential in the development of nu metal with their groove metal and alternative metal styles. Korn is often credited as pioneering the subgenre in the mid-1990s with their self-titled debut album. Nu metal became popular in the late 1990s, with bands and artists such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Slipknot all releasing albums that sold millions of copies. Its popularity continued through the early 2000s, with bands such as Papa Roach, Staind, and P.O.D. all selling multi-platinum albums. The popularity of nu metal came to a peak in 2001 with Linkin Park's diamond-selling album Hybrid Theory. By the mid-2000s, however, the oversaturation of bands combined with the underperformance of several high-profile releases led to the subgenre's decline, leading to the rise of metalcore and many nu metal bands disbanding or abandoning their established sound in favor of other genres.</p>
    <p>The style was used in many kinds of media from the period, including various advertising, seventh-generation video game consoles such as the Nintendo Wii, as well as in architecture and interior design. Windows Aero – the design language used by the Microsoft Windows operating systems beginning with prototypes of Windows Vista (2001–2006) – was among the first to feature characteristics of Frutiger Aero. The scholar Emirhan Avcı called Vista "one of the first mature examples" of the style, and, after its release, Microsoft published a style guide their designers had referenced when creating it. Windows 7 (2009), Vista's successor, expanded on these characteristics. Frutiger Aero waned in popularity in the early 2010s and was largely replaced by flat design in user interfaces and electronics. Avcı identified a transitional style, Frutiger Metro, named after the Metro design language used in Windows 8 (2012), which shared features of Frutiger Aero and later minimalist interfaces.</p>
